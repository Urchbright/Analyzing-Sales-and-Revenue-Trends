## Analyzing Sales and Revenue Trends: A Case Study of a Residential and Commercial Company

### Executive Summary:

Our analysis of the company's sales and revenue data reveals a concerning trend: despite achieving high sales figures, the company's revenue remains relatively low. This discrepancy suggests that the company is struggling with profitability, likely due to high costs or inefficient pricing strategies. To address this issue, we recommend a thorough review of the company's cost structure, pricing policies, and revenue streams. Implementing cost-saving measures, optimizing pricing, and exploring alternative revenue sources can help improve the company's profitability and revenue growth.

### Methodology:

This study employed a descriptive analytics approach, using historical sales and revenue data from the company's database. The data spanned several years and included monthly and yearly sales figures, as well as revenue data. The analysis was conducted using Excel and involved data visualization, trend analysis, and correlation analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

The EDA revealed fluctuations in sales across different months and years. In the residential category, sales peaked in July 2023 at $10,123k, while in the commercial sector, sales peaked in July at $8,608k. However, despite these high sales figures, the company's revenue remains relatively low.

### Detailed Analysis:

Our analysis of the company's sales data reveals fluctuations in sales across different months and years. In the residential category, sales peaked in July 2023 at $10,123k, while in the commercial sector, sales peaked in July at $8,608k. However, despite these high sales figures, the company's revenue remains relatively low.

In 2022, the company achieved sales of $4,528k in the residential category, but generated only $681k in revenue. Similarly, in 2023, the company achieved sales of $10,123k in the residential category, but generated only $1,232k in revenue. This discrepancy suggests that the company is struggling with profitability.

### Possible Causes of this Market Flunctuations:

1. High Costs: The company may be facing high costs, such as labor, materials, or overhead expenses, which are eating into its profit margins.
2. Inefficient Pricing: The company's pricing strategy may not be optimized, resulting in low revenue despite high sales.
3. Low-Priced Products: The company may be selling low-priced products or services, which generate low revenue despite high sales volume.

### Findings/Results:

The analysis revealed a significant discrepancy between sales and revenue. In 2022, the company achieved sales of $4,528k in the residential category, but generated only $681k in revenue. Similarly, in 2023, the company achieved sales of $10,123k in the residential category, but generated only $1,232k in revenue.

### Recommendations:

1. Cost Review: Conduct a thorough review of the company's cost structure to identify areas for cost savings.
2. Pricing Optimization: Analyze the company's pricing strategy and optimize it to ensure that prices are aligned with the value provided to customers.
3. Revenue Diversification: Explore alternative revenue streams, such as new products or services, to reduce dependence on low-margin sales.
4. Profitability Analysis: Conduct a profitability analysis to identify the most profitable products or services and focus on those areas.

### Conclusion:

The company's high sales figures are not translating into high revenue, indicating a profitability issue. By addressing the possible causes and implementing our recommendations, the company can improve its profitability and revenue growth.

### Limitations:

This study has several limitations. Firstly, the analysis is based on historical data and may not reflect current market trends. Secondly, the study only considers sales and revenue data and does not take into account other factors that may affect profitability, such as marketing and operational expenses.
